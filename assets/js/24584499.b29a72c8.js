The processing pipeline can automatically extract floor plans based on the IfcBuildingStorey elements. Furthermore, we have designed a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to select floors manually.\\n\\nThe tool is written in python programing language using open-source libraries and can be easily edited and adapted into specific requirements. The purpose of this tool is not only assist designers in generating floor plans at the desired building levels but also enable researchers to perform quantitative analyses on district or urban scales. We believe that our methodology and data workflow are applicable to other downstream tasks requiring large-scale quantitative analysis, such as material detection, volume estimation, and environmental impact prediction.\\n\\nThe source code of BatchPlan will be available in the following repository: [https://github.com/CarbonImage/BatchPlan](https://github.com/CarbonImage/BatchPlan).\\n\\nHere is a video that shows how to extract floor elevations and save them into a CSV file:\\n\\n<LiteYouTubeEmbed\\n  id=\\"Am9DdgLritE\\"\\n  title=\\"BatchPlan: Extracting Storey Elevations to a CSV File\\"\\n  noCookie={true}\\n  webp\\n/>\\n\\nHere is another video that shows how to extract floor plans:\\n\\n<LiteYouTubeEmbed\\n  id=\\"tXvWW_5FGRc\\"\\n  title=\\"BatchPlan: Floor Plan Extraction Using Storey Elevations\\"\\n  noCookie={true}\\n  webp\\n/>\\n\\nAnd here are some example images that are shown in the above video footage:\\n\\n![3D model of the building and the marked planes where the floor plans are extracted](./img/3D.png) ![3D representations of elements in the third floor](./img/floor-3D.png) ![Floor plan of the third floor](./img/floor-3D.png)"},{"id":"project","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/project","source":"@site/news/2023-03-16-welcome.mdx","title":"NWO Project Grant","description":"Our project titled Intelligent Carbon Footprint Prediction from Architectural Design Visuals has been granted by NWO.
